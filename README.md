# ASLPrep_paper
Paper Code and Data for ASLPrep: A Generalizable Platform for Processing of Arterial Spin Labeled MRI and Quantification of Regional Brain Perfusion

This repository contains all of the code and data required to replicate all of the figures. There are two scripts, one in R and one in Python (3).

ExtendedData3_4_8.py will recreate Extended Data Figures 3, 4, and 8.

AllFigures.Rmd will recreate all of the other figures.

In addition, copies of our paper figures, edited in illustrator for style (e.g., font size), are included.
